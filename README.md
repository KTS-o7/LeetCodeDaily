**LeetCodeDaily** (LCD) is a website to track LeetCode progress with friends.

## Background

My friends and I started with a basic spreadsheet to track our LeetCode progress and for mutual accountability. This quickly became kind of cumbersome, leading to the creation of LeetCodeDaily. Still in the development stage, but on its way to deployment :)

Having some previous experience with Flask, I decided to build this application using the same framework. In the future, I may consider porting it to a more modern framework like Next.js or Node.js.

## Features of LCD v5

- **Add Questions**: Easily add questions using their LeetCode titles (e.g., "1. Two Sum").
- **Daily Tracking**: Questions are added for the current day, aligning with UTC, which is the standard used by LeetCode.
- **Remove Questions**: Accidental additions can be easily removed.
- **Hyperlinked Questions**: Each question is hyperlinked to the actual LeetCode problem page - helps easily try out what the others are solving.
