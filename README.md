# LeetCodeDaily
Website to track LeetCode progress with friends.

My friends and I started with a basic spreadsheet to track our LeetCode progress and for mutual accountability. This quickly became kind of cumbersome, leading to the creation of the LeetCodeDaily (aka LCD) site. Still in the development stage, but on its way to deployment :)

I had some past experience with Flask, so decided to go ahead with the same. Might try porting to a more modern framework like Next/Node JS or the like.

Features of LCDv5:
- add questions using LeetCode titles (like "1. Two Sum")
- questions added to the current day (according to UTC, which is what LeetCode follows)
- remove questions in case of accidental addition
- hyperlinked questions to the actual LeetCode problem page - helps easily try out what the others are solving

Here is how LCDv5 looks:
