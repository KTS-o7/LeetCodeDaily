# LeetCodeDaily

**LeetCodeDaily** (LCD) is a web application designed to track LeetCode progress with friends, fostering mutual accountability in coding practice.

## Background

My friends and I initially used a simple spreadsheet to monitor our LeetCode progress, but this method quickly became cumbersome. To address this, we developed the LeetCodeDaily website, which is currently in the development stage and on its way to deployment! ðŸš€

Having some previous experience with Flask, I decided to build this application using the same framework. In the future, I may consider porting it to a more modern framework like Next.js or Node.js.

## Features of LCD v5

- **Add Questions**: Easily add questions using their LeetCode titles (e.g., "1. Two Sum").
- **Daily Tracking**: Questions are added for the current day, aligning with UTC, which is the standard used by LeetCode.
- **Remove Questions**: Accidental additions can be easily removed.
- **Hyperlinked Questions**: Each question is hyperlinked to its corresponding LeetCode problem page, allowing users to quickly access and solve problems.
